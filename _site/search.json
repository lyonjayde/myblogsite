      "contents": "\nThis summer the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks brought a fire to the Black Lives Matter movement that hadn’t been seen since the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2012 and Michael Brown Jr. in 2014. These killings also brought the rebuttal of “all lives matter.”\nSome may purposely say “all lives matter” to provoke conflict, and others may see it simply as an inclusive remark. But for most Black people across the nation, including myself, “all lives matter” is just reinforcing the fact that our lives don’t matter.\nIn my most impressionable years, people who looked like me were getting killed across the nation, with no justice being served. I was 13 years old when I found out about the killing of Trayvon Martin. I was sitting in the living room wearing a hoodie, as most teenagers do, as a picture of a Black boy wearing a hoodie came on the news who died because someone said he looked suspicious. Trayvon’s life mattered, just as my life does.\nThe reality is that saying “Black lives matter” is not saying that Black lives matter ‘more,’ it’s saying that all lives cannot matter until Black lives matter. With the recent realization of the extent of police brutality in this country; black men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men and black women, 1.4 times more likely than white women. Of the 1,016 people police have killed in 2020 Black people have been 28 percent of those, despite being only 13 percent of the population.\nFor many, like myself, in the Black community when we hear someone say “all lives matter,” we realize that it’s just taking away from the specific grievances at hand. We do agree that everyone’s life matters, but we are the marginalized group that is getting killed at a disproportionate rate right now. We aren’t saying to have cops kill more white people, or Asians, or Hispanics, we’re simply saying the killing of Black people in America needs to stop because our lives matter. We deserve the chance to graduate high school, to finish college, to sleep in our own beds, or to go get fast food in the middle of the night. Just because we have a darker skin tone doesn’t make us less of a person.\nIn many ways, the use of “all lives matter” by the white community is a form of gaslighting. Gaslighting is a tactic in which a person or entity, in order to gain more power (or in this case, maintain their power), makes a victim question what they know to be true, often about themselves making it difficult for the victim to see the truth. Those who are advocating for Black lives matter have done their research, the statistics support the disproportionate level of police brutality, gentrification, of mass incarceration among others. We experience blatant and subtle racism on daily basis. This is our reality.\nWhen you were in elementary school and it was your birthday, were your friends not allowed to sing happy birthday to you because all birthdays matter? If your house on fire would you want the fire department to water the house next to you because all houses matter? If you were in the hospital because of COVID-19 would you want your doctor to visit you last because all illnesses matter and he had to put a bandaid on someone’s papercut?\nInstead of exploring the reasons why the Black Lives Matter movement is even necessary, many have a knee jerk reaction, crying “all lives matter.” These people miss the point that the majority of American experiences tend to highlight whiteness and cater to its safety. ‘White is right,’ was engraved in the founding documents of this country. The structural roots of white supremacy and lack of concern for people of color continue to this day.\nBlack lives did not matter when they were inhumanely transported from Africa and dumped at sea. Black lives did not matter when hundreds were lynched at the hands of the KKK. Black lives did not matter when they were attacked by dogs as they peacefully protested. Black lives did not matter as they were buying skittles at a corner store. Black lives did not matter as they were choked for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Black Lives still do not matter today.\nReparations need to be had. The focus needs to be on the issues at hand. Because all lives can’t matter until Black lives matter. Until then, I will be standing proud, my black fist raised shouting Black Lives Matter for all to hear.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThe outbreak of COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus, has caused worldwide uncertainty and worry. Much like the outbreaks of Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Influenza; COVID-19 has prompted varied State responses, as no one knows for sure how to tread in this uncharted territory. In an effort to slow the rate of infection and prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed State governments across the world have implemented mandatory social distancing orders, enforceable quarantines, and forced closures of non-essential businesses. These measures have raised questions about what is the appropriate balance between interests in public health and safety on the one hand and civil liberties on the other. This paper explores one aspect of this conflict, specifically the scope of states’ legal authority to limit otherwise lawful demonstrations against the government using COVID-19 as a justification.\nTo understand the full scope of a states legal authority to limit demonstrations against the government because of COVID-19, we must first understand the (1) existing global health protection law and (2) international protections for individual human rights such as the right to move and the right to peaceful assembly (“Universal Declaration of Human Rights”). In this sense, there is a question as to what international global health framework exists, whether and to what extent it is enforceable, and how to find the balance between individual rights and protection of the health of the larger community. We must also consider how choices States are taking today to combat COVID-19 compare to the international legal framework that is provided. Additionally, where States have implemented harsher responses, there is cause to consider whether there is a legal justification for those responses and where those states may attempt to continue these restrictions once the outbreak has been contained or a vaccine has been found. This paper finds that States are within their legal authority to limit otherwise lawful demonstrations against the government by using COVID-19 as a justification, due to binding regulations implemented by the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the concept of the “right to health,” and the idea that the right to health is the basis of humanity.\nThe concept of a “right to health” is well-established and appears in statements of values numerous international bodies. Globally, the WHO is the primary intergovernmental body in the global health field, and the first to expressly underscore the importance of a right to health. The preamble to the Constitution of the WHO both defines ‘health’ and recognizes health as a right (World Health Organization). Article 12 of the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the ICESCR), drafted by the United Nations Economic and Social Council and adopted by most countries, recognizes the right to “the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health” (“International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights”). Additionally, Article 12 states that governments are obligated to take necessary steps for the “prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.” The UN Economic and Social Council have also stated that:\n\nThe right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights, including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to information, the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. These and other rights and freedoms address integral components of the right to health (“General Comment No. 14”).\n\nThis General Comment of the UN Economic and Social Council, the constitution of the WHO, and the ICESCR shows the importance with which the international community views public health.\nWhile the examples above guide the international community’s morality regarding the question at hand, they have also provided the framework for legally binding documents. The WHO has elaborated on the ICESCR’s concept of the right to the highest standard of health. According to a report released by the WHO and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the right to health is an “inclusive right” that includes freedoms; entitlements, including “the right to prevention, treatment, and control of diseases;” non-discriminatory factors, and universal access to good quality health services (“Fact Sheet No. 31”). The International Health Regulations (IHR), binding on all 194 WHO countries, provides nations with the autonomy to “prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade” (“International Health Regulation” Foreword). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a legally binding international human rights law framework, requires that restrictions on rights for public health reasons be lawful, necessary, and proportionate much like what is put forth by the UN Economic and Social Council (“International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”).\nIn recent history the international community has set in place multiple documents to establish protections for individual human rights - ones that could be threatened by the question at hand. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (the Declaration) is the most influential document in the history of human rights and sets out the fundamental human rights that should be universally protected. Although the Declaration is not legally binding, it has formed the groundwork for multiple treaties and acts as moral guidance for the international community. Within the Declaration, Article 13 sets out the right to the freedom of movement within one’s State borders and Article 20 provides guidance on the “right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association” (“Universal Declaration of Human Rights”). The Siracusa Principles, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council and UN Human Rights Committee, provides guidance on responses that restrict human rights for reasons of public health or national security. It states that any measures taken need to be limited in duration, specific, lawful, necessary and proportionate (“The Siracusa Principles…” Part I, B). Restrictions specifically on the freedom of movement may not be discriminatory. While documents like the Siracusa Principles and similar provisions within treaties grant states the ability to restrict individual rights for the greater good, they ensure that this power cannot be overused through their specific terminology. This distinction between if a state is overreaching its legal capacity or acting within the lines of what is written determines if a state has the legal authority to restrict certain actions.\nAccordingly, to fit within the limits of States’ legal authority to curb individual liberties during public health emergencies, restrictions such as social distancing, quarantine, or bans on large gatherings must be necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, of limited duration, respectful to human dignity and subject to review, according to international human rights legal framework. These restrictions, however, raise human rights concerns regarding the restriction of movement, freedom of expression, and civil society organizations. In principle, quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans are consistent with international rights norms. As noted above, states have the legal capacity through the ICCPR to restrict rights for reasons of public health or national emergency. This authority is also acknowledged in the UN Economic and Social Council’s General Comment 14. However, broad quarantines of undetermined lengths do not always meet those requirements and are often discriminatory towards at-risk populations in application. Moreover, sweeping restrictions on movement can lead to restrictions on other individual liberties such as freedoms of assembly and expression and thus must be carefully scrutinized. For instance, quarantines and lockdowns prevent those who want to demonstrate against the government from doing so, as people are unable to freely move.\n\nStates’ responses to the recent COVID-19 outbreak demonstrate how even strict, nationwide restrictions can be invoked in the interest of public health. In China, authorities quarantined close to 60 million people in a few days to limit transmission, though it was too late as many residents left the region before the restrictions went into effect (Richardson 2020). Authorities reportedly barricaded the doors of families who were suspected of being infected (Mozur 2020) and used drones to scold people who were outside without wearing a mask (Lindberg 2020). On the other hand, Italy imposed a lockdown with more protections for individual rights. The government eventually placed the entire country on lockdown with the ability to travel for essential work or health reasons, and those who disobeyed could be fined or jailed (Horowitz 2020). While these two examples show different ways quarantines/lockdowns could play out the core idea is the same: that both states are within their legal rights. The measures are necessary to achieve a larger goal, commensurate with the risk to human life, and directed at the population at large (not specific individuals or groups). While mandatory quarantines, lockdowns, and banning of large gatherings make it impossible to hold demonstrations against the government and could even result in fines, this is justifiable under existing international law on the basis of public health emergencies.\nThe second human rights concern deals with freedom of expression and subsequently access to critical information. Article 19 of the Declaration requires governments to protect the right to freedom of expression, including to seek, receive and impart information of all kinds. While this might not seem to pertain to the question at hand, it does where governments need to provide accurate information regarding COVID-19. If a state behaves like China, withholding basic information (“China: Respect Rights in Coronavirus Response”), or Iran, repressing widespread anti-government protests without providing COVID-19 information (“Iran: No Justice For Bloody Crackdown”), citizens will fail to listen to the government later on and will be more apt to disobey quarantines and launch demonstrations, as shown in Iran. However, it is shown that during COVID-19 the number of groups that have stopped or postponed, anti-government demonstrations have increased as the idea of a collective action to stop the spread of the pandemic has taken importance (Haldevang 2020). The third human rights concern deals with the protection of civil society organizations, who often participate in demonstrations against governments or other institutions. According to Article 25 of the ICCPR, governments are required to protect the right to participate in public affairs. During these uncertain times, in some cases states have welcomed public participation in the development of strategies in order to dissuade people from demonstrating together. The Iranian government originally proposed sending over 100,000 militia members door-to-door to screen for COVID-19, until Iranians reacted online saying that this would actually increase the number of cases in Iran (“Iran to Use Phone Checks…”).\nWhile the major issues of the question at hand have been addressed above, there does raise the questions of (1) ‘what if’ states attempt to extend the length, or target group, of these restrictions, and (2) is there going to be enforceable action taken against countries that have implemented harsher response. According to international public health law, government actions must be taken for the shortest period of time possible and may not become discriminatory. However, governments could attempt to push back against this notion as the world enters a “new” normal. For example, the Chinese government may find the quarantine of protesters in Hong Kong attractive and attempt to extend the quarantine until a new way to deal with protesters is found (Rose 2020). It could be argued that the Chinese government reopening the epicenter of the Hubei province but closing its international borders could be a way to continue the quarantine, to limit anti-government demonstrations. With the government’s increased civilian monitoring and unsuccessful attempts to quash the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, this provides an opportunity to continue to distance Hong Kong from the rest of the world to squash the pro-democracy protests. This raises the question, however, of who decides when restrictions are no longer necessary, and who enforces that decision.\nRecently, there have been reports of states implementing policies that restrict human rights to extents that are not in line with international human rights law, often resulting in excessive deaths. Kenyan government implemented restrictive policies on movement, including a curfew. The curfew, requiring people to stay in their homes from dawn to dusk, has led to increased police violence injuring and killing dozens through beatings and gunfire (Max Bearak 2020). In an opposite response tactic, the Brazillian president has “rejected” the calls for implementing a national, or regional, quarantine stating that “We’re all going to die one day” (Fearnow 2020). Though this differs from the example above, it is also a response that is not in line with international public health law that requires governments to mitigate the spread of epidemics. Like the question above, this raises an issue as to what actions will be able to be taken against these states, once a sense of normalcy has returned, and who is responsible for enforcing the actions. Within the ICCPR, States may make a written complaint against another state for not following the provisions of the treaty, but there is no harsh penalty for not following the provisions. This is one of the key sub-issues that may arise throughout the course of COVID-19 as since there is no harsh punishment for these harsher restrictions or lack thereof, states may not be inclined to follow international law guidelines.\nInternational human rights law guarantees everyone the right to health, while also allowing for governments to restrict other rights in order to protect the global public health. On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 had reached the level of a global pandemic. However, prior to this states began to enact quarantine, travel restrictions and lockdown measures in order to combat the spread of the disease in their own communities. While there is no evidence yet that states will attempt to continue any aspect of their lockdowns or quarantines, the possibility that this might happen is the only illegal part of the question at hand. Due to binding regulations implemented internationally through the WHO’s International Health Regulations and the UN, specifically the ICCPR, states are within their legal rights to limit otherwise lawful demonstrations against the government by using COVID-19 as a justification.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nAfrican music is a staple tradition in society that spans the continent, with music being used as a tool of celebration, protection, and communication. Research on politically engaged music has been prominent since the 1960s, with notable findings such as the conclusion that ‘although political music has dwindled in Western countries, “in Africa it never went away.”’ A review of this literature reveals that an increase in political protest music is linked to a renowned feeling of hope that something could, and would, change in each group’s respective country. Examining the cultural significance of ‘protest political music’ in the context of the current crises in Mali and Nigeria reveals that the international community, along with the African diaspora, should put greater effort into promoting African civil society through music. Spreading and promoting the protest political music being created in these regions today would put pressure on the Malian and Nigerian governments to change their practices and would and allow for a deeper understanding of the ongoing crises.\nIn 2012, in Mali, the mujahideen of Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO), Ansar Dine, and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) implemented a music ban over the two-thirds of the country they then controlled in order to “impose their authority” and stifle the possibility of a civilian uprising. In present day, music in Mali has resurfaced and often is used to speak out against both politicians and Islamic extremists, though there are new terrorist organizations fighting for control over portions of Northern Mali every day. In Nigeria, the musician Femi Kuti encourages artists throughout Africa to speak out against the problems encountered in African nations across the continent, in an effort to encourage Africans to identify with and feel invested in Africa again. In his song “Africa for Africa,” Kuti sings, “As Africans we must care for Africa. Africa for Africa,” elaborating on the fact that he feels that people no longer care about Africa and that “[Africans] have to wait for the West to tell us what is going on in other parts of Africa.” These two cases illuminate the prominence of music in Africa and a constant battle that reflects the state of many African countries.\nMusic in Africa\nAfrican music, much like the continent, has been shaped by the tumultuous history from pre-colonial times to present-day. The base of most of African music stems from African drumming, which was used as a form of communication and storytelling by local griots. This led to the introduction of tassou, a traditional type of rhyming. African music today has evolved towards two pathways: Afrobeats, which combines traditional African music with jazz and R&B; and African hip-hop, which is largely based on collaboration among artists. A central characteristic of African music is that people tend to represent themselves, their realities, and where they are from or their history, making way for music to act as a form of communication that is understood across borders.\nIn recent history, specifically with respect to African hip-hop, there have been multiple instances where music and social change have gone hand-in-hand. Music allows the artist to create an identity that the public can connect to and rally behind. This often leads to governments worrying that the artists’ words and what they represent can spark revolution. Music has also played a prominent part in social justice protests such as those during the Arab Spring and Y’en a Marre, where artists teamed up with journalists in an attempt to spread their truth and change the current system of oppression.\nProtest political music\nGarhe Osiebe argues that within popular music in Africa there is a musical genre called ‘protest music’ that includes the three subgenres of ‘protest political music’, ‘unity political music’, and ‘terrestrial praise political music’. Osiebe says that ‘protest political music’ is “aimed at criticizing the state as constituted by the status quo, or at criticizing the idea of nationhood in society.” Osiebe notes that as there have been more ethnic, religious, and minority conflicts through the years there has been an influx of artists that have at least one form of political music on their albums. This literature shows that there is growing concern for the political state of Africa among artists, who have the most contact with the general public. However, there are still issues with governments limiting public access to radio, music, and media. For example, this month Nigerian lawmakers proposed legislation that would penalize people with high fines if they posted or shared information online that the government deems ‘fake’. While this may seem to be aimed more at journalists than at musicians, the law is drafted very broadly. If the government deems lyrics of a certain song to be incorrect or not in line with their political beliefs, the government could both ban the distribution of that song and fine the artist, as well as any of the artist’s followers who have also shared or distributed the song.\nThis example from Nigeria only hints at the fear of repercussions that many African musicians face from their home country’s government. Since 2015, many private radio and television stations in Burundi have been attacked, causing artists to lose their platforms and then speak out. According to a Human Rights Watch report, the humanitarian situation in Burundi over the past two years have been devastating, with executions, rapes, abductions, and intimidation of political opponents by the Burundi ruling party youth league, the Imbonerakure. The Burundi government has labeled artists as enemies of the state and many of these artists have begun to seek refuge in other countries - from neighboring Rwanda to the United Kingdom.\nThe Case of Mali\nMali is a multi-ethnic country consisting of over 12 ethnic groups, with a historical divide between the ‘North’ and ‘South’ and no cohesive national identity. Contemporary Mali’s history has been filled with violence, including the Tuareg rebellion and multiple terrorist organizations fighting for control in the North. In 2012, MUJAO, AQIM, and Ansar Dine gained control of the Northern territory and implemented a ban on music because they did “not want Satan’s music.” This ban was then justified by government officials who said music “has a corrupting influence… distracting [Muslims] from their real duties: to pray and praise Allah.” The ban unsettled the already fragile national identity within Malian society and shows how people in power have attempted to, and in some cases succeeded in restricting public access to music to further their own goals - whether it be stopping the spread of information they do not like or which threatens their power or, as is the case with extremist groups, unsettling society in order to gain support.\nDespite these music bans, Mali has found its sense of national identity again through this crisis in its music. Specifically, because of the trauma associated with the Tuareg rebellion and terrorism in the region, Malians began to share songs of what was happening to them. These songs began to attract international attention around 2014. By diaspora communities sharing these songs from their homes through the internet, the artists and victims of conflict were able to get their message out to the world. While this was only one factor in improving conditions in Mali (with the introduction of French troops to combat the Islamist extremists playing a key role), it nevertheless shows the importance of music as a vehicle allowing artists to tell their story, speak out against their oppressor, and mobilize support from the international community.\nEarlier this year, Al-Qaeda’s Group for Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in Northern Mali. Since 2018, Mali has entered a new period of crisis consisting of attacks from both Islamist groups and the Malian army. While music alone may not be able to save countries in humanitarian crises, music can help these countries share their stories and garner international support, as Mali demonstrated in 2012-2014. Music in Mali was used as a venue of communication that allowed the international community to hear their cries.\nThe Case of Nigeria\nAlthough Nigeria transitioned from military rule to civilian rule in 1999, state corruption remained. Under President Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria still faced a corrupt police force that “beg[ged] like street beggars,” and a population suffering from hunger and starvation. Government corruption and indifference drew many artists in Nigeria to political activism. One of these artists was rapper Oladapo Olaitan Olaonipekun, aka Dagrin, who says a “failing football culture, an un-employing, un-proactive government, and worsening financial conditions of the citizenry,” are the reasons that Nigeria is not in a better political and economic state. Recently in 2017, Nigerian artist Saeon Moruda brought fellow Nigerian artists YCee, Vector, Iceberg Slim, and Terry Impala together for a protest song called #Aii (Remix) which points out the flaws within the government, but also shows, through the accompanying music video, the everyday hardships in Nigeria, such as the resource curse and high levels of illiteracy.\nFela Anikulapo-Kuti (1938-97), a political activist and the ‘grandfather’ of Afrobeat, was a Nigerian artist active during the period of military rule who spent his career criticizing the military regimes and allowing the space for a discussion of their policies to begin. Music became Fela Kuti’s tool in his attempt to put pressure on the Nigerian government, causing the state to feel threatened by him “because his anti-state politics reached many people, and those who felt powerless could relate to his messages and analyses.” Throughout his career Fela encountered harassment, prosecution, and imprisonment while speaking out against the government. Unfortunately, Fela died only two years before Nigeria was able to reach a democracy. While there are many factors that led to Nigeria’s transition to democracy, it would be unwise to not believe that Fela did not play a part in putting pressure on the military regimes and garnering public support for a change.\nCurrently in Nigeria there are three pressing concurrent conflicts: Fulani-related conflict, government and election insecurities, and Boko Haram. Most protest music is based on the political state of Nigeria, meaning that protest music most directly affects conflict that is election-related. Election-related conflict is on the rise due to the closeness of the February 2019 election and it includes “protests, riots, and clashes between groups,” of the All-Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). This causes a destabilization of the Nigerian government, that could be positive by inciting change or negative by allowing Boko Haram or Fulani-related conflicts to gain a footing.\nThe political and economic future of Nigeria is still very uncertain. However, music has allowed Nigerian citizens to have a voice in their crisis, giving them a platform to judge, criticize, and communicate. While this is still a dangerous thing to do, it has helped lead the country to democracy in the past. Music may not be a direct solution to the Fulani-related and Boko Haram crises in Nigeria, but it could indirectly help in both cases by putting pressure on the government to act and do more to protect its citizens. Political music’s influence could even help the government rehabilitate its reputation by nudging officials to dedicate a majority of their time and resources, more effectively, to crises other than the political, election-related ones.\nConclusion\nMusic has been used for expression, protest, and communications both domestically and internationally throughout history. In many parts of Africa, such as in Senegal and Burundi, music has been used to communicate the oppression that is occurring in the state. This use of music as communication has led to an influx of resistance through both the promotion of political education and collective action. Political music has also been met with violent reactions, showing both the power of the form and the dangers of speaking.\nMusic, when used politically, has the ability to create movements and ‘force’ governments into corners, so to speak. While the promotion of political protest music alone will not bring an end to the multiple crises facing African peoples, promoting this form of music could begin a conversation. If the international community and the African diaspora were to enable Africans to speak out about their governments, they might be able to start to hold said governments accountable. This is not an end or the solution but merely a proven step to beginning to solve political crises in Africa.\nBibliography\n“Aii (Remix) - Saeon Feat.
